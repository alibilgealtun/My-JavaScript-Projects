# Coffee Machine

It's basically a coffee machine you can buy coffee if there's enough amount of water, milk, coffee beans and cups in it.

You can fill water, milk, coffee beans and cups in it. (The machine would be grateful)  

You can take money from it (make sure you take the amount less or equal than in the machine) if you know the password. (There're some rumors that the password might be "ILoveCoffee")

You can also see the remaining water, milk, coffee beans, cups and money in it. 

These're the things this coffee machine can do. Enjoy your drink!
